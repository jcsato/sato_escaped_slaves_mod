## Features

<img src="./readme_assets/EscapedSlaves.png" width="1200">

Adds a new starting scenario, the Escaped Slaves, focused on protecting a core group of weak brothers from the City State that once imprisoned you. The quick summary:

- Start with five Indebted brothers and an assortment of stolen equipment.
- Indebted brothers gain a buff that makes them stronger for each other Indebted you field.
- The City State from which you escaped is always hostile and will periodically send manhunters* after you.
- Good relations with factions decay 15% faster, and bad relations recover 15% slower.

*The manhunters sent after you are a new mini-faction specific to this origin. They have a few unique unit types, and will ambush you without notice, so don't let your guard down!

## Requirements

1) [Modding Script Hooks](https://www.nexusmods.com/battlebrothers/mods/42) (v20 or later)

## Installation

1) Download the mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/jcsato/sato_escaped_slaves_mod/releases/latest)
2) Without extracting, put the relevant `sato_escaped_slaves_origin_*.zip` file in your game's data directory
    1) For Steam installations, this is typically: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Battle Brothers\data`
    2) For GOG installations, this is typically: `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Battle Brothers\data`

## Uninstallation

Don't use with Legends, that has its own version that is separately maintained.
